      <em>AWESOME product.This will actually shred more than 12 sheets as I found out by accident.<br> My wife told me
        I'd just shredded 16
        sheets. She should know.<br> It was our financial reports from several years ago. It didn't slow down much and,
        the paper was standard stock paper. Not the cheapy paper.<br> So, I LOVE this thing! I went through about 5
        years of

      <em>Amazing picture, features, ease of use at this low price! How does it stack up against Nest?
        This little camera is VERY impressive. <br>I currently own a Nest IQ indoor camera and have owned a couple
        Foscam
        indoor cameras in the past. <br>This Wyze camera produces excellent picture quality and has a very easy to use
        app.<br>
        The fact that you get 14 days of clips storage for free just blows the Nest cam out of the water.<br> This
        camera does so much that the 10x more expensive Nest Cam IQ at a fraction of the price</em><br><br>Reviewed in
